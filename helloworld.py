## 1. write a python code to add two numbers - user input

a = int(input("Enter the number"))                    ## by default if you input something it is treated as a string 
b = int(input("Enter second number"))                 ## In order to add the user input value you need specify the data type of user input value
print ("The Sum is " + str(a+b))                      ## Now again in order to concatenate the str value 'The Sum is' with the Int value you need to specify int as char.
